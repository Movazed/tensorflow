Installing Bazel on Fedora and CentOS

bookmark_border
This page describes how to install Bazel on Fedora and CentOS.

The Bazel team does not provide official packages for Fedora and CentOS. Vincent Batts (@vbatts) generously maintains unofficial packages on Fedora COPR.

The commands below must be run either via sudo or while logged in as root.

Add --allowerasing when installing an upgrade from a previous major version of the Bazel package.

The Bazelisk installer is an alternative to package installation.

Installing on Fedora 25

The DNF package manager can install Bazel from the COPR repository. Install the copr plugin for DNF if you have not already done so.
dnf install dnf-plugins-core

Run the following commands to add the Bazel repository and install the package:

dnf copr enable vbatts/bazel
dnf install bazel4
Installing on CentOS 7
Download the corresponding .repo file from Fedora COPR and copy it to /etc/yum.repos.d/.

Run the following command:


yum install bazel4
